### TbMigrate 4.2

# Important Note: Use cases.

_The TbMigrate tool, provided here, assists in migrating configuration from a Turbonomic V6 instance to a V8 one (or CWOM 2 to 3)._

_If, however you need a way to migrate configuration from one Turbonomic V8 instance to another, then you should use the [TbUtil HOT-WARM tool](https://github.com/turbonomic/tbutil/wiki/K8S-HOTWARM) in "single-shot" mode instead (although, that is not its primary use case)._


# Version compatibility

This release of the migration tool has been tested with Turbonomic version 8.3.0 or later.

For migrating to 8.2.x releases, please use [version 3.15 of "TbMigrate"](https://github.com/turbonomic/tbmigrate/blob/3.15/README.md)
